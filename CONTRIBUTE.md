# Contributing to DummyForMRI

Thank you for your contributions!

DummyForMRI is intended to be a pure python package producing a simple dummy head-like shape for pipeline code
testing. It is open to any further development suggestions and improvements aimed at increasing the 
complexity of the dummy shape while keeping the option of producing something simple for quick tests.
